## ðŸ§¹ **Data Cleaning Questions**

1. **Missing Data**
   * How many missing values are there in each column?
   * Replace missing `Age` and `Salary` with appropriate values (mean/median or default).
   * Fill missing `City` and `Name` with `"Unknown"`.

2. **Inconsistent Formatting**

   * Standardize all city names (e.g., `new york`, `NY`, `New York` â†’ `New York`).
   * Convert all `Name` entries to proper case (e.g., `bob` â†’ `Bob`).

3. **Incorrect Data Types**

   * Convert the `Age` column to numeric and handle non-numeric entries.
   * Convert `Join Date` to datetime format and fix inconsistencies.

4. **Outliers and Invalid Values**

   * Find and remove outliers in `Age` and `Salary` (e.g., negative or unrealistic values).
   * Identify and correct invalid email formats.

5. **Duplicates and Irrelevant Columns**

   * How many duplicate rows are present? Remove them.
   * Drop the column `Unnamed: 0` if it's unnecessary.

6. **Fix Categorical Data**

   * Group spelling variants in the `Name` column (e.g., `Charlie`, `Ch@rlie`) into a single name.
   * Create a column showing the standardized version of names and cities.


Great! Here are **more advanced and practical data cleaning and analysis questions** you can add to your checklist. These go beyond basics and help simulate real-world scenarios:

## ðŸ§¹ **Additional Data Cleaning Questions**

7. **Standardization Across Columns**

   * Ensure all `Salary` values are in the same currency or format (e.g., remove text like `"fifty thousand"`).
   * Replace all blanks (`""`) consistently with `NaN`.

8. **Cross-Field Validation**

   * Are there any employees with a salary but no name or city?
   * Are there any entries where the `Join Date` is in the future?

9. **Conditional Corrections**

   * If `Age` is missing but `Salary` is present, impute age based on similar salaries.
   * If `City` is missing but `Email` contains a city-based domain (e.g., `nyuser@example.com`), infer the city.

10. **Check Unusual Patterns**

* Are there any names that appear more than 50 times?
* Are there any age values that cluster around unrealistic values (e.g., many people aged 150)?

11. **Flag Potential Errors**

* Create a new column called `Data_Quality_Flag` to mark rows with multiple issues (e.g., invalid email **and** missing age).

12. **Feature Engineering**

* Extract year from `Join Date` and store in a new column `Join_Year`.
* Create a boolean column `Is_Valid_Email` based on regex checks.
